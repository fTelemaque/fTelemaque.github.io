		<h1>My name is Fokly Telemaque</h1>
		<p>I am a cloud infrastructure student and front-end web developer. I love coding, solving problems and creating new things. In my free time, I enjoy playing the piano, painting, reading and writing books, listening to jazz and classical music and playing soccer. I hope, with all the knowledge I have gained over the years, to build a technology company that brings significant value to people and inspires the next generation. I believe that technology is a great tool for innovation and the evolution of humanity, which can bring hope for a better future.</p>
